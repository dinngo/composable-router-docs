# ðŸŒŸ Why Protocolink?

## **User Problems**

* Users often face the need to send and wait for **multiple transactions** to achieve a desired scenario
* As more **networks** and **protocols** enable constant switching and utilization, convenience may come at the expense of **security risks**, such as token approval.

## **Developer Problems**

* Developing on-chain applications often requires overcoming **substantial barriers**, such as **mastering smart contract** development and deployment.
* Integrating with different networks and protocols can be challenging due to their **diverse interfaces**.
* It is difficult to build a user base from scratch, and the cost of **maintenance** is high.

## Solution&#x20;

[**Protocolink**](broken-reference) can bundle various logics in **one transaction**, and provide a [**API**](broken-reference) and [**SDK**](broken-reference) for developers to easily integrate their own application requirements.&#x20;

This empowers developers to create products with greater possibilities, while reducing maintenance time and costs, as well as the learning curve.&#x20;

Additionally, it enables users to seamlessly enjoy advanced experiences with their EOA wallet and minimizes friction in using the product.

## Advantages

### Enhance extensibility while mitigating contract risks

* New integrations only need to be submitted in TypeScript, and external developers can easily send a pull request to a GitHub repository for integration. This greatly enhances the developer experience and significantly reduces deployment time.
* Users are safeguarded against risks associated with admin actions, such as arbitrary updates to smart contracts, as all smart contracts are designed to be non-upgradable.
* The Router/Agent architecture effectively reduces the risk of integrating new protocols, as the integration of a new protocol does not pose additional risks to existing protocols or users.

### Build on DeFi/NFT projects without needing to learn smart contracts

* Developers can leverage Protocolink to build diverse products or bots without the need to develop smart contracts. This empowers developers to prioritize user experience or algorithm design.
* Developers can combine different DeFi and NFT projects to create novel use cases, leveraging the full composability of blockchain technology.

### Improve the user experience of token approval

* By integrating Permit2, users who have used Uniswap can save on gas costs by eliminating the need for separate approval transactions, while also benefiting from a safer approval mechanism.

### Support ERC-721 and ERC-1155 protocols

* Both the DeFi and NFT markets widely adopt these standards to build their products. Protocolink can continuously integrate these protocols, enhancing their usability.
