# Zap-in & Zap-out

## Current Situation

Most services require the consumption or generation of specific tokens. With this functionality, users can directly access services without impacting their asset configuration, thereby lowering the barriers to entry for various services.

## Zap any Token in / out

Using the router with permit2, users can have a better user experience in cross-protocol token authorization, and the Router can combine multiple transactions at once. For example, integrating DEX Swap functionality before or after means users can use any token input in any protocol function or exchange it into any token when withdrawing tokens.
