# ‚ùì FAQ

### 1. Is  the Composable Router Open Source?

We have open-sourced all our contracts and SDKs, except for the API. This enables developers to save time on research and focus on building products for users by either building upon the SDKs or accessing the API.

### 2. How do we decide which protocol to implement?

The Composable Router has the ability to interact with any contract. Our **API/SDK** provides developers with the ability to develop applications more quickly for certain protocol logic. If you do not have a desired protocol logic to use, you can [submit pull requests (PRs)](https://github.com/dinngo/composable-router-logics) for integration. We will implement them based on **security**, **requirements**, and **cost**.

### **3. What** Composable Router solve**?**

1. The popularity of Web3 has led to an explosion in the number of protocols, and user have more demands on the **user experience**.
2. Existing features require users to leave your product to do a certain action.&#x20;
   1. Provide a jump to other services and come back after the operation.
   2. Learn to write smart contract and add it to the service so that it can be done in one go.&#x20;
3. Method 2-2 has a better experience but also has many costs&#x20;
   1. There are many things to consider like how much approve amount to add to the logic.&#x20;
   2. Different chains and different protocols have different interfaces, each of which takes time to learn.&#x20;
   3. Application contract changes are costly to redeploy or maintain each time.
4. Composable Router is able to **aggregate** many protocols to make them more accessible to users. We focus on the "**composable**" feature of blockchain for several years, just to reduce your **development cost** and provide a **better experience** for users.

### 4. Why is composability important?

In the Web3 blockchain, the composability feature of smart contracts enables innovation because it allows anyone to adapt or build on top of existing programs, and composability leads to more options and a better user experience, unlocking new use cases that did not exist in Web2 traditional finance. We believe that composability is a new and infinitely possible feature if people want to be at the forefront of Web3 innovation.
