# âš™ API

With our REST API, you have the freedom to create your own logic for any required scenario. Once you have composed your logic, our API will automatically calculate the necessary predecessor requirements for the user. This means that you can use the API directly without needing to worry about the complexity of the logic you have composed. We also take care of composing the corresponding transaction data according to the requirements, making it easy for the user to send it directly.

### Getting started with the API

We provide comprehensive guides that cover the essential principles of our API. These guides will walk you through the integration process of our endpoints into your dApp, step by step.
