# âš™ API

Our REST API allows you to compose your logics for the required scenario and will calculate the predecessor requirements for the user after this logics is composed. This means you can use it directly without taking into consideration the complexity of the composed Logic. We compose the corresponding Transaction data according to the requirements so that the user can send it directly.

### Getting started with the API

We offer several guides to teach you about the most important principles of the API. They will teach you step by step how to integrate our endpoints into your dApp:

1. [A quick start guide on how to swap + supply token](swap+supply-example.md)
2. [How to request all tokens supported by the logic](requesting-tokens.md)
3. [How to request quotation by the logic](requesting-a-quote.md)
4. [How to estimate the router data](estimate-logics-result.md)
5. [How to build transaction request data](requesting-transaction-data.md)
