## TypeScript SDK (Recommended)

Our SDK simplifies communication between APIs and DeFi/NFT smart contracts, allowing you to combine them to create diverse use cases within your interface.

{% content-ref url="integrate-js-sdk/install-sdk.md" %}
[install-sdk.md](integrate-js-sdk/install-sdk.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## API (REST)

Our REST API provides comprehensive information and enables deeper and customized integrations.

{% content-ref url="integrate-api/api/" %}
[api](integrate-api/api/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Smart Contract

By directly integrating with our Smart Contract, you can meet more advanced and flexible application requirements.

{% content-ref url="smart-contract/router-smart-contract/" %}
[router-smart-contract](smart-contract/router-smart-contract/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
