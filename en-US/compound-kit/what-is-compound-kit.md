# ‚ùá What is Compound Kit

The Compound Kit empowers developers to rapidly build applications and enhance user experience with the Compound protocol.

Building an application on top of the Compound Protocol can be a challenging and time-consuming process due to the inherent risks associated with working with smart contracts, as well as the complex calculations and encoding required for various use cases, such as collateral swap, self-liquidation, leverage and zap.

The Compound Kit eliminates the need for developers to spend time and resources on building and maintaining their own smart contracts. By leveraging [Protocolink](../why-protocolink.md), developers can add more use cases in a highly modular way, without deploying new contract, and significantly reducing user risk. By providing practical use cases, it empowers developers to build applications more easily while reducing both development time and costs.
